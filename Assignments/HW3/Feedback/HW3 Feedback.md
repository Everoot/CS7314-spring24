# HW3 Feedback

1. The boundary made for the EPC approach is incorrect, but the process for selecting the points is correct. For the Weak Nx1 approach you need to identify that the region is made up of several boundaries and a combination of on and off points need to be selected for each of these boundaries. (-2) 

   > EPC方法的边界设定是错误的，但选择点的过程是正确的。对于Weak Nx1方法，你需要识别区域是由几个边界组成的，并且需要为这些边界的每一个选择一组开和关的点的组合。

2. The list representation of the FSM is incomplete. Please check the chapter slides and/or the book for complete list representation. (-0.5)
